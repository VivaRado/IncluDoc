### **Design**

IncluDoc gathers Markdown files, handles include statements and generates a main README.md and/or a multilingual README.html with a user interface.

A file can have alternatives and you can choose which gets included and compiled.

The user interface and SVG on the documents are designed to work with ```prefers-color-scheme: dark``` and react to dark and light mode.
