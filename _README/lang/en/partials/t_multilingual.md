### **Templates / Multilingual**

Generate multilingual documentation, with a user interface.


#### Multilingual Directories:

IncluDoc will gather every language directory within ```/lang``` compile and combine that into separate MD documents, placed in those directories as ```README_collected_{lang}.md```.

The HTML version of the docs after generating will appear in ```_README/README.html``` with a user interface to toggle between the languages.
